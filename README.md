# Intro
The project is a rather simple classification model, the main focus was to deploy the project with 
streamlit and pyngrok.

# Motivation
i wanted to learn about streamlit web app deployment , through a simple ML model implementation for determing the gender of  an application
using their height and weight as features.

# Conclusion 
The project was rather easy but gave me a good introduction Deploying web apps rather easily.
